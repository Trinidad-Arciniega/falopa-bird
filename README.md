## Introduccion 

In the city of CetiGotham, where skyscrapers rose through the mist and danger lurked on every corner, a mysterious bat-squirrel appeared. No one knew her name or origin, but her bravery and determination stood out. The citizens, paralyzed by the menace of Mr Skunk and his corruption, waited for a savior to restore hope.
To reach Mr Skunk, the bat-squirrel had to face light amid the darknessâ€”knowing that only her courage could save CetiGotham.
